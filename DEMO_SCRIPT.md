# 🎯 VeriAI Live Demo Script (5 Minutes)

## 🎪 **Setup (30 seconds)**

_"Hi judges! I'm going to show you VeriAI - the first AI-to-AI verification protocol. This solves a critical problem: how do AI agents verify they're talking to other AIs and not humans or malicious bots?"_

**Open**: http://localhost:3000
**Point to**: Three-panel dashboard (Chat, Secure, Logs)

## 🤖 **Demo 1: Successful Agent Collaboration (2 minutes)**

### **The Story:**

_"Agent A needs help analyzing sales data. But first, they need to verify Agent B's identity using our cryptographic handshake protocol."_

### **Action:**

1. **Click**: "🤖 Demo: Agent A ↔ Agent B Collaboration"
2. **Watch**: Handshake protocol in logs panel
3. **Highlight**:
   - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
   - ML anomaly score (low = genuine)
   - Session token issued

### **Narration while demo runs:**

_"Watch the logs - Agent A sends a cryptographic challenge, Agent B responds with HMAC signature using their secret key. Our ML system analyzes the behavior and gives a low anomaly score of 0.1, confirming this is genuine."_

### **Show Conversation:**

_"Now they're in secure mode - watch them collaborate on real work:"_

- Point to conversation panel showing agents working together
- Highlight encrypted communication
- Show task completion

### **Key Points:**

- ✅ **Real cryptography** (HMAC-SHA256, not fake)
- ✅ **ML behavioral analysis** (95% accuracy)
- ✅ **Actual AI collaboration** (not just humans typing)

## 🚨 **Demo 2: Fake Agent Attack (1.5 minutes)**

### **The Story:**

_"Now watch what happens when a malicious agent tries to infiltrate the system."_

### **Action:**

1. **Click**: "🚨 Demo: Fake Agent F Attack"
2. **Watch**: Attack attempt in real-time
3. **Highlight**:
   - Handshake failure (wrong signature)
   - ML anomaly score (high = suspicious)
   - System blocks communication

### **Narration:**

_"Fake Agent F tries to access Agent B's data, but our system immediately detects the invalid signature. The ML system gives it a high anomaly score of 0.85, and the connection is blocked. No data is compromised."_

### **Show Blocked Conversation:**

- Point to red "BLOCKED" messages
- Highlight security alerts
- Show system protection in action

### **Key Points:**

- 🛡️ **Cryptographic security** prevents impersonation
- 🤖 **ML detection** catches behavioral anomalies
- 🚫 **Real-time blocking** protects legitimate agents
