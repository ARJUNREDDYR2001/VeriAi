# VeriAi
We are building an AI-to-AI verification protocol that enables autonomous agents to confirm they are interacting with trusted AI's, not humans or malicious bots, by shifting from plain conversation into a secure “secret mode” of communication. This creates a new trust layer for multi-agent systems, fraud prevention, and secure AI collaboration.
